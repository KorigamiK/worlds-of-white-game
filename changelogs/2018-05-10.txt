Converted World Orientation

  The original tutorial I had started with was set up to be Y-up. Naively thinking Blender was Y-up as well, I carried on doing things that way. But, then I decided it was a lot less cognitive overhead for me if it was Z-up. Upon inspection, I realized Blender was also Z-up; I had even put in a model transformation to account for this. I changed the camera, model orientations, and movements to be Z-up. I think this'll make things easier for me in the long run.


Tessellation Shader for Line Segmentation

  I implemented the line segmentation in the geometry shader myself. However, it means I'm at the limit of the geometry shader vertex output, it adds a lot of complexity to it, and the tessellation shader is designed for this purpose. So the segmenting and edge-detection got moved there, so the geometry shader can focus on line-drawing (and depth detection).


Aspect Ratio Handling

  Made it so that the vertices are mapped into window space before doing transformations and mapped back into projection space when drawing the lines. That way I don't have to worry about aspect ratio when programming special effects.


Custom Shading Effects

  Toyed around with some shader effects, namely ones that rough up the model; like adding variation to the rotations or adding directional offsets to simulate movement or action. I'll get around to it more later on when I was to spice up animations or just add special effects.
