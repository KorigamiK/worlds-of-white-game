Automatic file reloading

  I want to do more modeling, but some of the design work will depend on how it looks in-engine. So I've added logic such that file changes can trigger models to reload from file. I also added a slightly different camera that lets the controller move it around, but when left idle will slowly rotate around; good for showing off stuff.
