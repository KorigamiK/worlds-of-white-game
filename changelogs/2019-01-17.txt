Sketch-like Shader Testing

  Still working on a shader for a sketch-like texture effect. I think I've got a good method of having multiple levels of detail for the lines on shadertoy. But, a difficult part of it is also getting it applied to surfaces in-game. So I've been a bit demotivated lately because of the difficulty of it and making slow progress.


Future Work

- Finish shading method
- Better blob character
- Level features + gameplay mechanics
