Character Model

  Finally finished modeling and rigging the preliminary character model. Spent a lot of time figuring out how to do the feathers, and rigging mostly. I'll likely be upgrading/redoing it in the future with just more detail or maybe different techniques, but this is more than good for now.


Future Work

- Terrain/Map design
- Physics
- More animations
